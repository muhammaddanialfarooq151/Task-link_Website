Task-link-your expert connections
This HTML code creates a responsive service-listing website called TaskLink – Skilled Services.
It follows modern HTML5 structure and uses Google Fonts and Font Awesome for clean typography and icons.
The internal CSS styles the website with gradients, shadows, animations, and smooth scrolling.
A sticky navigation bar helps users easily move between different sections of the page.
The hero section uses a full-screen background image with animated text to attract users.
Service categories are displayed using responsive cards arranged in a grid layout.
Each card is interactive and triggers JavaScript when clicked.
JavaScript dynamically shows professional details based on the selected service category.
The “How It Works” section explains the platform in simple steps with scroll animations.
Overall, the code demonstrates effective use of HTML, CSS, responsiveness, and basic JavaScript interactivity.
